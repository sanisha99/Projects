# ### Comments:

# We have added hashtags in the code itself for better understanding of what we have coded by viewers.

# ### Part 1:

# Here we have created a dictionary for Eliza. where it contains three parts in it they are Pronoun_transformation, Transformers, Feelings. In the Pronoun_transformation part we have included words that help in converting the input of user to the output of the robot for example 'I' becomes 'you' etc. Next, is the transformers where we have included the key concepts it changes to questions or conversation to reply back us(Regular Expressions). Then in the final part feelings we have included most of the keywords and common answers to those questions.

# ### Part 2:

# In this part we have written the code for eliza to analyze if the input is gibberish, then we have written code to analyze the transforms pattern statements to understand and return the response. Then, we have given code to find the Keywords(word spotting) from the input to understand the information and give reply back accordingly. At, last in this part we have included the exit words for the user that they can give as an input to exit from the conversation.

# ### Part 3:

# In this part we are processing the users input, performing pronoun transformation, removing stop words and lemmatizing the words. Here we have also included a bonus function if we give an input and that is unknown by eliza then it asks to " I would like to know more about it. Can you tell me?" then we can give an answer or skip. If answer is given it will store for further conversation in that session.

# ### Example:

# For example, if a user says, "I feel sad," ELIZA would recognize the word "sad" and could reply in a manner that acknowledges the user's emotional state like

# => [user] i feel sad 

# ->[eliza] Being sad can be hard. I'm here for you. 

# For example, if a user says, "I have a problem," ELIZA would recognize the word "problem" and could reply in a manner that acknowledges the user's statement like: 

# => [user] I have a problem 

# ->[eliza] I can try to give a solution for this problem! 

# To reflect back statements as questions, the program includes tranforms in eliza_dict to encourage the user to dive deeper into their own thoughts and feelings, simulating a therapeutic conversation.

# For example:if a user says, "i am afraid that {any_sentence}" 

# => [user] i am afraid that my life is full of mess 

# ->[eliza] Why are you afraid that your life is full of mess? 

# => [user] i am a negative thinker 

# ->[eliza] Why are you a negative thinker?

# ### Keywords:

# Some of the Key words that we have used to build a conversation are: happy, sad, depressed, sick, dreams, food,mother, father, sister, sad, angry, sleep, adivce, lost,etc,.
